| `fno-05` | Scalper | — | `fno-01`, `dash-20` | From ScalpPro on F&O home or the Scalper bottom-nav tab. The chart-tools sheet groups personal DASH AI indicators separately from Lemon indicators. |
| `fno-06` | Scalper · DASH indicator | — | `fno-01`, `dash-20` | From DASH AI’s View indicator. Opens the chart-tools sheet directly on Indicators, the saved DASH AI indicator under Your indicators with a focus guide. Tap rows to add / remove indicators (several at once); search filters the list. |
| `fno-07` | Scalper · indicator applied | — | `fno-01`, `dash-20` | With the saved DASH AI indicator on the chart: “1 ▾” at the chart’s top-left and illustrative EMA 9 / 21 lines on the NIFTY 50 candles. |
| `fno-08` | Commodities home | [6754:63637](https://www.figma.com/design/nLs24dTJdPz9A5pu3AWMbe/?node-id=6754-63637) | — | The Commodities product tab. Gold / Silver / Crude Oil / Natural Gas shortcuts open the Lot summary (Gold Summary). The chart’s instrument selector (“Gold”) opens the contract picker. Popular commodities: Options ⇕ Futures switch; Futures Heatmap: Bullion / Energy / Metals. |
| `fno-09` | Commodities · heatmap & Smart Futures | [6754:63637](https://www.figma.com/design/nLs24dTJdPz9A5pu3AWMbe/?node-id=6754-63637) | — | The same long screen, scrolled to the Futures Heatmap. |

Equity / Commodities tabs in the sheet header’s bottom slot, commodity chips (All, Gold, Silver …) under them; contracts grouped by commodity as radio rows (Gold Mini tagged “Lowest Margin”). Picking one updates the chart and closes the sheet. |
| `fno-11` | Contract picker · Equity | [6754:65054](https://www.figma.com/design/nLs24dTJdPz9A5pu3AWMbe/?node-id=6754-65054) | — | The same sheet on its Equity tab: the 8 index contracts. |
| `fno-12` | Gold Summary · by price | [6754:65113](https://www.figma.com/design/nLs24dTJdPz9A5pu3AWMbe/?node-id=6754-65113) | `fno-08`, `fno-17` | From a commodity shortcut on fno-08. Gold lot tabs (Gold, Gold Mini, Gold Guinea, Gold Ten, Gold Petal) in the Actionbar’s bottom slot; Futures (View all) and Options (View option chain, expiry month, category pills, Filter, sort). The sort opens a sheet: By Price · By Volume · Margin per lot. |
| `fno-13` | Gold Summary · by volume | [6754:65288](https://www.figma.com/design/nLs24dTJdPz9A5pu3AWMbe/?node-id=6754-65288) | `fno-08`, `fno-17` | Sorted by volume: each option shows its traded volume, no change. |
| `fno-14` | Gold Summary · margin per lot | [6754:65444](https://www.figma.com/design/nLs24dTJdPz9A5pu3AWMbe/?node-id=6754-65444) | `fno-08`, `fno-17` | Sorted by margin per lot: each option shows the margin for one lot, no change. |
| `fno-15` | Strategies · Equity | [6754:64178](https://www.figma.com/design/nLs24dTJdPz9A5pu3AWMbe/?node-id=6754-64178) | — | The Strategies product tab with Equity selected in the pill group: shortcuts, Zing Trades, Smart Invest, Pre-build Strategies (Nifty 50 ⇕, Bullish / Bearish / Neutral / Volatile), Quick Trade. Card footer buttons stay Small (32) as in Figma. |
| `fno-16` | Strategies · Commodities | [6754:64607](https://www.figma.com/design/nLs24dTJdPz9A5pu3AWMbe/?node-id=6754-64607) | — | The same tab with Commodities selected: commodity Smart Invest baskets, GOLD as the underlying. |
| `fno-17` | Option chain | [11630:16785](https://www.figma.com/design/nLs24dTJdPz9A5pu3AWMbe/?node-id=11630-16785) | `fno-01`, `fno-21` | From Option chain on the F&O chart (any product tab) or the Option Chain bottom-nav tab; Back → F&O home. Opens scrolled to the spot pill. BankNifty ▾ and Expiry ▾ open sheets; Σ shows delta instead of the day change; the basket and Zing tile open the explanatory sheet. Column heads: Call / Put metric (LTP, OI, OI Chg, IV) and the strike range (All, ±5, ±10). Tap a price to Buy, tap it again to Sell, a third time to clear. |
| `fno-18` | Option chain · Buy selected | [11630:16184](https://www.figma.com/design/nLs24dTJdPz9A5pu3AWMbe/?node-id=11630-16184) | `fno-01`, `fno-21` | A put price tapped once: B badge, green wash, the order dock with the contract, Balance / Req, quantity in lots and Buy (brand). Buy places a sample order (toast) and clears the selection. |
| `fno-19` | Option chain · Sell selected | [11695:26269](https://www.figma.com/design/nLs24dTJdPz9A5pu3AWMbe/?node-id=11695-26269) | `fno-01`, `fno-21` | The same put tapped again: S badge, red wash, Sell (secondary) in the dock; Req becomes the margin per lot. |
| `fno-20` | Option chain · illiquid contract | — | `fno-01`, `fno-21` | Illiquid contracts (deep in-the-money calls, far out-of-the-money puts) carry a block icon beside the price, like Groww. Unlike Groww, a tap never selects them: a tooltip opens just above — “Illiquid contract · can’t be traded ⓘ”; tapping away closes it, ⓘ opens a sheet with why it’s blocked, its traded lots and buy–sell gap, and a tip. Opens on the 25,700 put with the tooltip up. |
| `fno-21` | Asset page · Gold MINI | [6754:61613](https://www.figma.com/design/nLs24dTJdPz9A5pu3AWMbe/?node-id=6754-61613) | `fno-18`, `fno-17`, `fno-05` | A commodity contract page. Entry (one of several): the contract name in the option chain order dock (“25,400 Put ›”). Back returns where it came from; Option chain → fno-17; Buy / Sell open the sample sheet. Equity contracts get their own (similar) page later. |
| `fno-22` | Asset page · illiquid | [6754:61613](https://www.figma.com/design/nLs24dTJdPz9A5pu3AWMbe/?node-id=6754-61613) | `fno-17`, `fno-05` | Product rule (commodities only): an illiquid contract’s page shows the ILLIQUID tag next to its name and Buy / Sell greyed out, with “Trading is not allowed as this contract is illiquid” above them — whatever screen it was opened from. |
| `fno-23` | Gold Summary · Buy / Sell sheet | — | `fno-08`, `fno-17` | Tapping any futures or option card opens the Buy / Sell sheet (live app, 2026-10-29): name › (asset page fno-21) · price, expiry · change, Buy (brand) / Sell (secondary). |
| `fno-24` | Gold Summary · illiquid sheet | — | `fno-08`, `fno-17` | Product rule (commodities): an illiquid contract carries the ILLIQUID tag on its card (edge case — illiquid contracts shouldn’t be listed, but the state is built) and in the sheet; Buy / Sell are greyed out with “Trading is not allowed as this contract is illiquid”. Only the name › (asset page fno-22) or tapping outside works. |

### Structure

- `screens/Home.tsx`: page composition, scrolling, modal state, local watchlists.
- `components`: F&O sub-navigation, the Stocks-home-matching header, P&L and indices, chart, discovery, contracts, heatmap.
- `sheets/HomeSheets.tsx`: single-choice sheet, create watchlist, contract details and unavailable-destination sheet.
- `data.ts`: typed snapshot contracts, indices, watchlists, chart series and heatmap cells.
- `copy.json` / `copy.ts`: translatable UI copy. Market names and values live in data.
- `commodities/` — the Commodities product tab and its pages: `components/CommoditiesFeed` (the tab's sections in order), `CommodityShortcuts`, `PopularCommodities`, `CommodityHeatmap`; `sheets/ContractPickerSheet` (“Choose options contract”); `screens/LotSummary` (Gold Summary); `data.ts` (commodities, contracts, heatmap groups, picker groups, gold lots — the API contract for this tab); `assets/` (commodity artwork exported from Figma, resized to 2× / 3×).
- `option-chain/` — the Option chain: `screens/OptionChain` (top bar, selectors, stats, column heads, strike rows, spot pill), `components/OrderDock` (the order panel), `data.ts` (underlyings, expiries, chain quotes — the API contract).
- `strategies/` — the Strategies product tab: `components/StrategiesFeed` (pill group, Zing Trades, Smart Invest, Pre-build Strategies, Quick Trade cards); `data.ts`.
- `screens/Home.tsx` renders the shared header, P&L, indices and product tabs once, and the selected tab's feed under them (`product` prop). Equity, Commodities and Strategies reuse the same sections where Figma does (watchlists, chart, contract cards, sheets).
- `assets`: exported Figma artwork for Zing, product tabs, shortcuts and chart actions. Monochrome paths use L3 MaskIcon; detailed shortcut artwork keeps its original SVG with inversion in dark mode.

### Navigation and behaviour

Main F&O → fno-01. Home → stocks-01. Search → search-25 (F&O selected, Back → fno-01). ScalpPro and the Scalper tab → fno-05; Back → fno-01.
Profile → profile-01; Wallet → deposit-01; DASH → dash-02. These shared flows retain their existing return behaviour.
The other F&O navbar items open a sheet explaining that those destinations are outside this prototype; they do not switch the selected Equity tab.

- Total / Day P&L switches the displayed example.
- Index selector uses a sheet of Radio rows. Chart metric tabs update the example series.
- Watchlist shortcut scrolls to the section. Add watchlist validates a nonblank name (40 characters max), adds a local empty list and shows a success toast. Changes last while the home is mounted.
- Contract cards open details. Instrument scope changes Index / Stock. Category pills select example orderings; By Price / By Volume changes the displayed value and sorts volume descending. Calls / Puts filters include an empty result when the sample has no puts.
- View all on Smart Options / Smart Futures opens the existing combined signals list (index / stock scope respectively); these are shared prototype lists, rather than newly designed destinations.
- Heatmap filters show subsets of the example snapshot. Stock / Index changes labels. Tiles open details.
- Sheets use shared Sheet hosting and L3 focus management, Escape and backdrop dismissal.
- **Scalper (fno-05)** is rebuilt from the live app's screenshot (2026-10-26, dark), measured to it at 392 wide:
  - top: back · strategy tabs (L3 ribbon "All", recoloured with the Tabs' own variables so it runs into the tool row)
    · Add more strategies (Zing-edged ring); the tool row (36, surface/primary, dashed line under it): Positions ·
    Orders · Option chain, then the Active chip (Zing tint, count 14 on its icon) running off the right edge — the row
    scrolls sideways;
  - two chart panels on surface/primary, a 16 band with a drag handle between them: instrument (name ⇅ underlined,
    Spot ⇅, link-charts), price · change · ▲ (percent) in the up colour; the spot panel's buttons are chart type
    (US-stock blue tint) and chart tools, the option panel has chart tools only;
  - each chart (`components/TradingPane`): candles, a 50-wide price axis with round steps and the last price tagged in
    the up colour (dashed line to it), the session high / low marked with value · dot · line, zoom in / out against the
    axis, a time axis every 50 minutes (12:15 … 15:25 / 12:25 … 15:35) and "5m ▾" in the corner;
  - order dock: Market / Limit-Trigger (L3 pill group, outlined), Buy at Mkt (brand) · quantity in lots (L3 Stepper
    Large, steps of one lot = 65) · Sell at Mkt (secondary), the margin each needs and the funds under the stepper.
  Values and candles are illustrative (`data.ts`, traced from the screenshot, high / low pinned to its markers); no
  order is submitted.
- **Chart tools sheet** (`sheets/ChartToolsSheet`, from either panel's tools button; fno-06 opens with it up): a 96
  **Side nav** column (L3 `SideNav`, discover tone, Zing flag: Range · Zing NEW · Indicators · Drawings · Templates · Settings) and the
  chosen group beside it. Indicators: **Your indicators** (made with DASH AI, Create indicator, or "No indicators
  created yet.") and **Lemonn indicators**, each a starred 32-tall row. DASH's View indicator opens it with the saved
  indicator listed. Picking one closes the sheet and applies it (fno-07): its name under the spot quote and two
  illustrative moving-average lines (EMA 9 / 21 of the sample candles) on the spot chart.

#### Commodities (fno-08 … 14)

- Product tabs: Equity → fno-01, Commodities → fno-08, Strategies → fno-15. The header and tabs don't move; only the content below slides (forward = from the right, back = from the left).
- **Shortcuts** Gold · Silver · Crude Oil · Natural Gas (artwork, name, day change in up / down colour) → Gold Summary (fno-12).
- **Chart**: same as Equity, the instrument selector reads “Gold ⇕” and opens the contract picker (fno-10). Picking a contract renames the chart and closes the sheet.
- **Contract picker** (`ContractPickerSheet`): header “Choose options contract”, underline tabs Equity (8) / Commodities (7) in its bottom slot; on Commodities, pill chips All / Gold / Silver / Crude Oil / Natural Gas / Copper / Aluminium / Zinc filter the groups. Rows: ListCell Small with artwork, name, price + change, a “Lowest Margin” discover Tag where it applies, Radio. The selected row is highlighted (ListCell `selected`).
- **Watchlist** — same as Equity.
- **Popular commodities**: Options ⇕ Futures switch (secondary pill), divider, pills Top traded / Top gainers / Top Losers / Advanced declined, Filter (sheet) and By Price ⇕ By Volume. Option card: name + type | expiry left, price + change right. Future card: price and change on one line, “Margin / lot : …” under it. Options shows the frame's own rows (three calls and one future).
- **Futures Heatmap**: Bullion / Energy / Metals pills, 3-column tiles in profit / loss surfaces; a tile opens its details.
- **Smart Futures**: the Equity section with commodity contracts.
- **Gold Summary** (`LotSummary`): Actionbar back (→ fno-08) + “Gold Summary”; lot tabs with artwork (Gold, Gold Mini, Gold Guinea, Gold Ten, Gold Petal) in the bottom slot, scrolling sideways. Futures (View all) — two future cards. Options (View option chain → the F&O options list) — expiry month pill (October ⌄ → month sheet), divider, Top traded / Most active / OI gainers / Top gainers, Filter, sort. Sort opens a sheet: **By Price** (price + change), **By Volume** (traded volume only), **Margin per lot** (₹ per lot only) — fno-12 / 13 / 14 open on each. Filter Puts shows the empty state (the sample has calls only).

#### Strategies (fno-15, 16)

- Shortcuts (as Equity), then a full-width **pill group Equity / Commodities** (fno-15 / fno-16).
- **Zing Trades** (Explore): rail of cards — trader avatar, strategy name, “Built with DASH Ai”, today's return; divider; Last week (M T W T F dots: green = profit, grey = no trade, red = loss), Avg. trades, Win rate (trending icon); grey footer: ☆ save · Learn in 30 Secs (play ▶ ›) · Apply (primary).
- **Smart Invest** (View all): rail of cards — logo, basket name, By lemonn, min. deposit; 7 Days P&L ⇕ 30 Days (switcher) with an eye to hide it, AUM, Slots left (🔥 80/100); grey footer: Monthly charges ₹0 ~~₹300~~, Invest now (primary). The card itself isn't tappable (it holds buttons).
- **Pre-build Strategies** (Explore): underlying pill (Nifty 50 / GOLD ⇕ → sheet), divider, Bullish / Bearish / Neutral / Volatile; rail of cards — Probability of profit, strategy name, Funds Req, Max Profit (Unlimited or ₹) / Max Loss, payoff sketch (loss area left, profit area right).
- **Quick Trade**: ⚡ Quick Trade · Beginner friendly; “Which way will GOLD ⌄ move?” (underlying → sheet); Up • Bullish (green outline) and Down • Bearish (red outline).
- Destinations outside this prototype (Explore, Apply, Invest now, Learn, Up / Down) open the explanatory sheet.

#### “What does illiquidity mean?” sheet (shared)

`sheets/IlliquidSheet` — one explainer for every illiquid entry point in F&O: the ⓘ in the option-chain tooltip, and a tap on any ILLIQUID tag (asset page, Buy / Sell sheet, Gold Summary card). Same pattern as DASH's Pine Script sheet: small header (“What does illiquidity mean?” + “{contract} is illiquid right now”, or a general line from a tag), a card with three icon + one-line points (very few people trade it · buy and sell prices are far apart · Lemonn doesn't allow orders, to protect you), Got it.

#### Buy / Sell sheet (fno-23, 24)

`commodities/sheets/ContractSheet` (live app, 2026-10-29): any futures or option card on Gold Summary opens it. Name › (asset page) · price; expiry · type · change; Buy (brand) / Sell (secondary) docked. **Illiquid** (commodities, product rule — same from any entry point): ILLIQUID tag in the sheet, Buy / Sell greyed out with “Trading is not allowed as this contract is illiquid”; only the name › (→ the illiquid asset page) or tapping outside work. The card itself also carries the ILLIQUID tag — an edge case kept in development (illiquid contracts aren't meant to be listed in discovery, but can still reach a list). Sample: GOLD 24000 CE.

#### Commodity asset page (fno-21, 22)

`commodities/screens/AssetPage` (Figma 6754:61613), data `AssetPage` in `commodities/data.ts`:
- Actionbar: back · ☆ (watchlist, toggles). Head: name + contract (“Gold MINI 5 OCT Fut”), price + change, commodity art.
- Chart (the Scalper's trading pane: candles, price axis with last-price tag, high / low, zoom, time axis, 5m) and the tool row Range · 5m Interval · Indicators · Drawings · Settings; Option chain (→ fno-17) and ScalpPro (→ Scalper fno-05) side by side (Figma 6754:62688: two Secondary, 40 tall, light outline). ScalpPro is disabled for an illiquid contract.
- Contract Info (key–value rows with dashed separators: days to expiry, margin, leverage, price unit; the tender-margin notice with ⓘ); {NAME} Futures rail; Performance (24H low / high bar with the last traded price, Prev. Close / Open / circuits / tick size / price unit); Trading details; Market Depth (bids | asks, totals). Buy (brand) / Sell (secondary) docked.
- **Illiquid (commodities only, product rule):** ILLIQUID tag (error, secondary) next to the name, Buy / Sell disabled, and “Trading is not allowed as this contract is illiquid” above them — whatever the entry point.
- Entry so far: the contract name in the option-chain order dock (“25,400 Put ›”). More entry points (Gold Summary cards, search, watchlists) to come. Equity contracts get their own, similar page.

#### Option chain (fno-17 … 19)

How option chains behave (Sensibull, Dhan, Zerodha, the live Lemonn app) and how this one does it:
- **Layout:** strikes ascending down the page in a grey middle column; calls on the left, puts on the right. Each side shows the chosen metric (LTP by default) with the day change under it.
- **Spot:** a black pill (“25300.40 +5.56%”) on a thin band between the two strikes the spot falls between; the chain opens scrolled so the pill is in the middle (at the money). Calls above it / puts below it are in the money.
- **OI bars:** a 2px line on each row's bottom edge — call OI in red running left from the middle, put OI in green running right, scaled to the largest OI in the chain.
- **Strike tags:** OI Support (the strike below spot with the most put OI, green), OI Resistance (above spot with the most call OI, red), Max Pain (blue, the stats row's value).
- **Selecting:** tap a call or put price → selected to **Buy** (green B badge on the strike side, green wash from the outer edge) and the order dock rises. Tap it again → **Sell** (red S badge, red wash, Sell button). A third tap clears it. Tapping another price moves the selection there (as Buy).
- **Order dock:** B / S + “25,400 Put ›” (contract details) · “Set Limit • TP/SL ›”; Balance and Req (buy = premium × quantity, sell = margin per lot); quantity in lots (L3 Stepper, steps of one lot, “1 lot”); Buy (brand lime) or Sell (secondary). Placing shows a success toast and clears the selection — no order is sent.
- **Top:** back (→ F&O home) · ribbon “Option chain” · Add more strategies (+); BankNifty ▾ (underlying sheet) | Expiry: 09 Oct ▾ (expiry sheet), Zing signals tile with count; Σ (Greeks: shows Δ instead of the day change) · basket · PCR • Max Pain • ATM IV; column heads: “Call LTP” / “Put LTP” (metric sheet: LTP, OI, OI Chg, IV), “All” (strike range: all, ±5, ±10 around the spot). Changing underlying or expiry clears the selection.
- **Illiquid contracts** (`quote.illiquid`; here deep in-the-money calls 24,700–24,900 and far out-of-the-money puts 25,700–25,900): a block icon (Material `block`, content/tertiary) beside the price on the strike side, as in Groww. Unlike Groww, a tap never selects them: an L3 Tooltip opens above the price — “Illiquid contract · can’t be traded ⓘ” — on a tap only (never hover or focus). It closes by itself after 5 s, when another contract is tapped, on tap-away or Esc. ⓘ opens the shared `sheets/IlliquidSheet` (see “What does illiquid mean?” below).
- **Entry:** Option chain on the F&O home chart (all product tabs), the Option Chain bottom-nav tab, and View option chain on Gold Summary.

Differences: lot size 35 (BankNifty) so the stepper starts at 35 / 1 lot (Figma's “10000 · 91 lots” is placeholder); quotes are computed sample values (Figma repeats 292.15 / 25100); the stepper is L3 Stepper Large (Figma draws a bordered box with round ± buttons); Max Pain 25,400 so its tag sits where Figma draws it. L3 gaps: an option-chain row / table (strike column 107, row 54, dock header 44 → local tokens `--app-size-chain-*`), B / S order badges, OI bars.

### L3 components

Scalper: Screen, Button (ghost, tertiary, brand, secondary), Tabs (ribbon, pill group), Stepper, BottomSheet,
ListCell (card, Small), SideNav, Icon, Stack. New here, from L3 tokens only:
- **Side nav** — now L3 `SideNav` 1.0.0 (added to the design system from this sheet; was a flow copy).
- **Trading pane** (`components/TradingPane`) — L3 gap: L3 Chart is a fixed 360 × 200 picture without high / low
  markers, zoom, a timeframe control or a real-size price axis.

Screen and Rail are shared app composition helpers. The F&O header matches Stocks home in its profile, search, DASH and wallet controls; other controls use BottomNavbar / NavIcon, Button, Card, Tabs (including the explicitly requested Ribbon), Select, Chart, PriceChange, Tag, SectionHeader, BottomSheetHeader, Radio, TextField, EmptyState and Aerobar. Layout uses Stack and Inset. CSS uses semantic L3 tokens, including profit/loss heatmap surfaces.

### Differences and prototype limits

Scalper vs the live screenshot: L3 sizes win where they differ — the order buttons are L3 Medium (40, the live app's
are 35) with radius 16; the sheet's top corners are L3's 24; type is Manrope (L3), a little wider than the live app's,
so the tool row reaches the Active chip slightly later. The Zing glyph on Active and the Zing tile is Material
swap_horiz (L3 has no Zing mark icon). Colours map to the nearest L3 tokens (panels surface/primary #161616 vs the
live #1d1d1d).

The source uses old D2 controls alongside L3; their code equivalents are L3 components rather than hand-built lookalikes, including L3 shortcut buttons. The header matches Stocks home, including its search pill, DASH entry and wallet. The profile uses the app's fictional Rohan Mehta instead of AG. The misspelled watchlist name “Specail 25” is corrected to “Special 25”. Chart candles are representative data rendered by L3 Chart; chart metrics and data are illustrative, with no market/API or order execution integration. Repeated Figma quotes, historical expiry text and the red/green JSWSTEEL pattern are preserved, including the source's inconsistent negative percentages in green cells. The product tabs match Figma exactly (approved exception to L3 Ribbon): grey row, green baseline (local token `--app-fno-tabs-baseline`, green 300), Label/12, and the selected tab's success-green outline over a green-50 → white wash. The Zing signals card matches Figma too: flush with the left edge, open on the left, honey outline (border/accent/zing) and a honey-50 → white wash, content left-aligned.

#### Commodities & Strategies vs Figma (6754:63073)

- D2 parts → L3: section titles → SectionHeader (View all / Explore), D2 pills → Tabs pill / Tab action, the asset list cards → ListCell Small inside a bordered group, D2 tabs → Tabs underline (sheet header bottom slot, Actionbar bottom slot), card buttons → Button, D2 tags → Tag, card shells → Card (footer / footerFilled for the grey strips).
- Commodity shortcut buttons match Figma exactly: 52 white circles with a light outline and faint glow, 32 art (L3 Tertiary button overridden; local tokens `--app-size-commodity-shortcut`, `--app-commodity-shortcut-glow`).
- Card footer buttons (Zing Trades, Smart Invest) and Quick Trade stay Small / Medium as in Figma, not the app's Large default — the user asked for the same UI as the frames.
- Price changes show their sign (“+0.10%”, L3 PriceChange); Figma shows “0.10%”.
- Figma's “Gold Gunia” tab → Gold Guinea; “1,65,4500.23” margin → 1,65,450.23; western “₹186,456” → ₹1,86,456; “ViewAll” → View all.
- The Zing trader photo is replaced by initials (fictional trader); the Smart Invest logo by the basket's initials.
- Equity (8) in the picker lists 8 indices (Figma draws 6). Copper, Aluminium and Zinc have no artwork yet, so their chips and rows show the name only.

#### L3 gaps (Commodities & Strategies)

- Commodity artwork (L3/Image/Commodities/… in Figma) isn't in the code package — exported PNGs live in `commodities/assets`; Copper / Aluminium / Zinc missing.
- Outlined Buy / Sell buttons (Quick Trade): L3 Button has filled Buy / Sell only; the flow tints Secondary with the up / down tokens.
- Payoff sketch on strategy cards: no L3 mini payoff chart; drawn as a small SVG on L3 tokens.
- Weekday result dots (Zing Trades): no L3 component; 16 circles on the up / down light surfaces.

### Changelog

- 2026-10-29 — Illiquid explainer simplified (small header, three icon points like the Pine Script sheet) and shared: opens from the chain's ⓘ and from every ILLIQUID tag.
- 2026-10-29 — Buy / Sell sheet from Gold Summary cards (fno-23) with the illiquid state (fno-24: tag on the card and in the sheet, Buy / Sell disabled).
- 2026-10-29 — Commodity asset page (fno-21) with the illiquid state (fno-22); opened from the option-chain order dock's contract name.
- 2026-10-29 — Illiquid contracts in the option chain: block icon, tooltip instead of selecting, ⓘ details sheet (fno-20).
- 2026-10-29 — Option chain (fno-17 … 19) from Figma 11695:26269: chain with spot pill, OI bars and strike tags, Buy → Sell → clear selection, order dock; opened from the chart's Option chain button and the bottom nav.
- 2026-10-29 — Product tab switch: every home tab screen is one page (group `home`), so the header, P&L, indices and tabs stay put and only the content under the tabs slides in from the chosen tab's side (scrolls back to the tabs if they were scrolled away). Product tabs and the Zing card rebuilt exactly as in Figma.
- 2026-10-29 — Commodities tab (shortcuts, Gold chart, Popular commodities, Bullion / Energy / Metals heatmap, Smart Futures), contract picker sheet (Equity / Commodities), Gold Summary lot page (by price / by volume / margin per lot) and the Strategies tab (Equity / Commodities: Zing Trades, Smart Invest, Pre-build Strategies, Quick Trade) from Figma 6754:63073; product tabs now switch between the three.

- 2026-10-27 — Chart-tools sheet states from the live app: nothing on the chart (“Indicators” · search); some on the chart (“Indicators (N)” · bin · fx with the count · search, each one a blue row with ✕, several at once — tapping toggles, the sheet stays open); search (field in the title's place, results wrap, full height). Focus guide from DASH: dimmed sheet, Your indicators lit, one-line tooltip with ✕. Scalper top as the live light screenshot: grey header band, Zing ring on Add, tools spread with Active cut at the edge, one tools button per chart, “N ▾” at the chart's top-left, reset on the option chart; light mode greys (surface/secondary) the header, the band between the charts and the order dock (dark keeps black).
- 2026-10-27 — Chart-tools sheet uses L3 SideNav 1.0.0 (design system moved to 571a418); the flow's own copy is removed.
- 2026-10-27 — Scalper rebuilt from the live app's screenshot: measured layout, trading chart panes (price axis, last-price tag, high / low markers, zoom, time axis, timeframe), the tool row with the Active chip, the order dock, and the chart-tools sheet with a new Side nav.
- 2026-10-26 — Added Equity home and board positions, connected the F&O tab and existing flows, added local selectors, filters, watchlist creation and details sheets.
- 2026-10-26 — Reused the Stocks home header on F&O, including its scrolled surface and all four actions.
- 2026-10-26 — Added Scalper: an L3 workspace from the ScalpPro shortcut, with two intraday charts and order controls.
- 2026-10-26 — Added the Scalper chart-tools bottom sheet and Indicators list from the supplied reference.
- 2026-10-26 — Grouped the chart-tools list into Your indicators and Lemon indicators; linked DASH AI's View indicator
  action to the saved custom indicator in the open sheet.
