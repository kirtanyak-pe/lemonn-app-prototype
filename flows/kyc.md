# Flow: Account setup (`kyc`)

> One self-contained file for converting this flow to another platform. Read https://kirtanyak-pe.github.io/lemonn-app-prototype/CONVERT.md first. Design system: Lemonnade V3 @ `571a418` (components, tokens and rules: https://kirtanyak-pe.github.io/lemonnade-v3-docs/llms.txt).

KYC after login: PAN, details and declarations, nominee, bank account and F&O activation.

## Spec (README.md)


> The spec for this flow. A developer should be able to build it on any platform (Flutter, iOS, web) from this file,
> the Figma links and the screens in this folder — without reading the rest of the repo.

- **Prototype:** https://kirtanyak-pe.github.io/lemonn-app-prototype/#/kyc · one screen: `#/kyc-01`
- **Figma:** [User flow – auth, account setup](https://www.figma.com/design/sG24GPizTdwbMBxLm0IpTA/?node-id=2103-86)
  (screenshots of the live app, old design system — this flow redesigns them in L3)
- **Status:** ✅ · last updated 2026-10-16
- **Entry:** Login, after the email step (`login-09`), arriving with an "Email verified" toast
- **Exit:** "Add money" → First deposit (`deposit-01`); "Explore stocks first" → the app

Three stages, shown up front and tracked in a progress bar under the top bar: **1 Verify your identity** →
**2 Add your bank account** → **3 Activate F&O (optional)**.

### Data

From `src/shared/data/user.ts` (fictional sample user — never real customer data) and `data.ts`:
- `user`: name, father's name, date of birth, occupation, marital status, PAN (`ABCPM1234K`, shown masked
  `ABCPM••••K`).
- `bankAccount` / `foundBank`: bank, account number (shown `••••••••••7821`), IFSC, type, branch.
- `stages[]`, `fetchSteps[]`, `segments[]` (`cash` always on; `fno` optional), `declarations[]` (8 regulatory
  statements), `settlementOptions` (30 / 90 days), `relationships[]`, `nominee`, `PENNY_DROP` (₹1),
  `riskDisclosure[]`.
- API: PAN lookup by mobile → fetch PAN / personal / bank details from the KRA (three results, each can be slow) →
  save segments, settlement, declarations (one consent with timestamp) and nominees → bank lookup by PAN, or IFSC
  lookup + penny drop → account-aggregator consent (CAMSfinserv) → F&O review status.

### Components (L3 → any platform)

| Where | L3 component (Figma name) | Props / variant |
|---|---|---|
| Top bar | Actionbar | title + `onBack`. kyc-01 has none — nothing to put in it, so the content starts 24 below the status bar |
| Stage progress under the bar | ProgressBar (`components/StageBar`) | "Step 1 of 3 · Verify your identity", value by stage |
| Headlines | `Intro` (src/shared/ui) | Heading/24 title + Description/14 secondary; `align="center"` on result screens |
| Stage list, fetch list, progress | L3 `Steps` | done ✓ / current / loading / to do, with a connector line |
| Illustration | **Illustration slot** (`Spot`, src/shared/ui) | md 64 in sheet headers and kyc-17, lg 96 + halo on result screens |
| Sheets | BottomSheet + BottomSheetHeader | `size="lg"` + `icon` for confirmations; small header for details / date |
| Sheet and screen buttons | ButtonGroup ("L3: Button Dock") | vertical: primary over secondary; horizontal for Edit / Done, Skip / Save, Add another / Done |
| Facts (PAN, bank, personal, nominee) | KeyValueList + KeyValueRow | `variant="card"` |
| Segments, agree tick, same-contact tick | ListCell | `variant="card"`, `as="label"`, `multiline`, Checkbox in `trailing` |
| Nominee row, Add a nominee | ListCell | `variant="card"`, `as="button"`, chevron `iconRight`, share in a neutral Tag |
| Unused-funds setting | ListCell + Select | Select `size="sm"` (opens a 30 / 90 days picker) |
| Declarations | Card | bulleted Description/12 list |
| Relationship | Tabs | `appearance="pill"`, `emphasis="secondary"`, `behavior="toggle"` |
| Fields | TextField | PAN, name, Aadhaar last 4, account number ×2, IFSC (`status="success"` + bank/branch helper) |
| Date of birth | TextField (read-only, calendar icon) → DatePicker in a sheet | `max` = today |
| Toasts | Aerobar | `floating`, `emphasis="primary"`: success (Email verified, Nominee added), warning (Slow connection) |
| Loaders | Loader | `size="lg"` in the penny-drop sheet and the handoff screen |
| CAMSfinserv handoff | `External` (src/shared/ui) | filled Card + "External" Tag + the provider's steps |
| Layout | Section · Stack (Figma auto-layout frames) | Forms: Section `paddingBlock="24" paddingInline="16" gap="24"` under the Intro → Stack `as="section" gap="16"` per block; segment rows Stack `gap="08"`. Status screens (fetching, F&O handoff / received, done): Stack `justify="center"` filling the body → Section 24 / 16, `gap="24"`. Sheet bodies: Stack `gap="16"`. Step bar: Section `paddingBlock="12" paddingInline="16" gap="08"` |

### Rules & behaviour

- **PAN:** 5 letters, 4 digits, 1 letter (`/^[A-Z]{5}\d{4}[A-Z]$/`), auto-capitalised. If a PAN is linked to the
  mobile, it's offered first (masked); otherwise the field.
- **Fetching:** three calls (PAN, personal, bank); each row turns ✓ as it returns; after ~5 s without a result show
  the "Slow connection" toast; moves on when all three are back. Personal details are read-only — corrections go
  through support.
- **Segments:** Stocks & mutual funds always on (disabled tick). Ticking F&O shows the risk disclosure sheet
  (SEBI-mandated) every time; un-ticking needs no confirmation.
- **Declarations:** listed in full, agreed with one tick; "Confirm and continue" stays off until it's ticked. Store
  the consent with a timestamp.
- **Nominee:** optional ("Recommended · you can skip this"). Relationship, full name, date of birth (not in the
  future), last 4 of Aadhaar (not verified). One nominee = 100%; with several, shares must add up to 100% (up to 10).
- **Unused funds:** running-account settlement every 30 or 90 days (default 90).
- **Bank:** account number typed twice and must match; IFSC is 11 characters and looked up to show the bank and
  branch. Penny drop sends ₹1 shown as "Lemonn" on the statement; the name at the bank must match the PAN name (on a
  mismatch: an error sheet and "Add a different account" — not drawn).
- **F&O:** optional; "Skip for now" / "Do this later" both go to kyc-20 with F&O not started. Approved on CAMSfinserv
  → review, usually 24–48 hours, with a notification.
- **You're all set** shows what's done and what's pending (F&O under review only if it was started).

### Differences from Figma

- **One flow for everything after login.** The live app jumps between native screens and a web page ("KYC already
  completed"); kyc-20 replaces that page with a native "You're all set" that leads into the first deposit.
- **Stage progress** (`Step x of 3`) under every top bar, so people always know how far they are.
- **PAN found** became a confirmation sheet with the PAN masked, instead of a plain screen.
- **Declarations:** the separate toggles became one readable list + one "I agree" tick.
- **F&O risk disclosure** opens as a sheet when F&O is ticked, instead of a separate page.
- **Nominee:** relationship as pill choices, the address/email/phone question as one tick, a nominee summary sheet
  from Confirm details.
- **Bank:** the penny drop and the verified state are sheets over the bank screen; the verified sheet shows the
  overall progress and offers F&O.
- **CAMSfinserv** (third party) is a handoff placeholder (kyc-18), not a redraw of their pages.
- **Artwork:** old illustrations became illustration slots; all customer data in the screenshots was replaced with the
  fictional sample user.

### L3 gaps

- **Illustrations:** L3 has none for onboarding / results; `Spot` slots stand in (marked `data-illustration-slot`).
- **Stage progress:** made from ProgressBar + a label (`components/StageBar`); an L3 "stepper header" would replace it.

### Changelog

- 2026-10-16 — first version (20 screens).
- 2026-10-19 — the step lists use L3 `Steps` (1.0.0); the local `shared/ui/Steps` is gone. Current is now a green dot
  with a light halo, to do a 16 ring, and done / current / loading rows have 24 below them.
- 2026-10-21 — layout moved from CSS-module classes to the L3 layout blocks (Section, Stack); nothing moved (measured at 392).
